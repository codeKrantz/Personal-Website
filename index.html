        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am a high achieving highschool student who gives 110% into eveything that I do. I am currently interested in becoming a 
            software engineer focusing on fullstack develoment while implementing AI. I have been coding and programming for three years
            after starting with an into to computer sciance course my freshmen year. I then moved to taking two semesters of programming 
            which were survey courses of the Java and Python Languagues. I am currently enrolled in AP Computer Science A and I will be taking 
            the AP exam in May. Though my experince in these class I have had to learn many of the skills an actuall developer would use,
            such as logic, understaning of commen data structures, and the ability to google effectively (which is really hard for some people in
            my AP class!). I have also taken my tech journy beyond the classroom by earning a varity of certificates in differnt Languagues and skills
            and also commiting my major assinments and passion projects to github. My overal goal for becomming a programmer is to be somone who
            is always driven to learn new skills and consepts to help build the future we want today.
